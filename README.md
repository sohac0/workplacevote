# workplacevote
Workplacevote is a deliberately insecure web application. It is an Idea Bank that can be used in a workplace. People can submit new Ideas anonymously and vote (like) other peoples ideas. The ideas with most votes will be used and it is up to the ADMIN to remove approved/disapproved ideas.

It is based on the cybersecuritybase-project and can be run just like it.
